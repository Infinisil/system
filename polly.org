* Configuring Amazon Polly to Synthesize Speech using the Command Line

** Create an AWS Account

Go to [[https://aws.amazon.com/][AWS]] and create a free account. This requires you to enter address, phone number, credit card number.

** Add a user for Polly access

- Sign into your AWS account and go to the console (you should be redirected to it anyways)
- Open the IAM service (e.g. by searching for it in the search bar)
- Add a user by clicking on Users > Add User
  - Username could be e.g. "say"
  - For access type, enable Programmatic Access
  - For permissions, click "Attach existing policies directly"
  - Search for "Polly" and select AmazonPollyFullAccess
  - Create the user. Now you can see the Access Key ID and the Secret access key, you *need* to save them somewhere *now*, you won't see the Secret access key ever again.

** Configuring the CLI

- Install the AWS CLI, on NixOS the package is called ~aws-cli~.
- Run ~aws configure~, now enter your Access Key ID and Secret access key
- For default region name, choose one of the ones listed [[http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#pol_region][here]] (as of 30 May 2017 one of "us-east-2", "us-east-1", "us-west-2", "eu-west-1").
- For default output format, enter "json"
- Press enter

** Querying AWS

Run a command like this to create a file with the synthesized speech:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
aws polly synthesize-speech --output-format ogg_vorbis --voice-id Justin --text 'Hi there!' out.ogg
#+END_SRC

** Simply playing the file

Install the ~sox~ package, which provides the ~play~ command:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
play out.ogg
#+END_SRC

And that's basically it!

Here is a simple zsh function to say the first argument:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
function say() {
	file=$(mktemp)
	aws polly synthesize-speech --output-format ogg_vorbis --voice-id Justin $file --text $1 && play $file
}
#+END_SRC

** Notes

Pricing information can be found [[https://aws.amazon.com/polly/pricing/][here]], it's very cheap for personal use.
