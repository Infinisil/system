* Nixops evaluation

This directory allows you to use the nix-build/nix-instantiate/etc. commands directly with the nixops derivations, which are not exported with nixops by default.

Usable by running a command like this in the current directory

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  nix-instantiate --eval -A nodes.emma.config.networking.hostName
#+END_SRC

Building a certain system fully can be done with
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  nix-build -A nodes.emma.config.system.build.toplevel
#+END_SRC
