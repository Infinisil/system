* Development process for Haskell
** With stack

- stack new <name> simple
- Set nix: enable: true in stack.yaml
- Open in emacs and wait

New dependencies:
- Add to <name>.cabal
- In emacs: (lsp-restart-worspace) and wait

Compiling from CLI:
- stack build

Compiling with Nix:
- stack2nix . > default.nix
- nix-build -A <name>

*** Notes

I think it should be possible to use nix' ghc and packages by giving some --use-system-ghc flag to stack.
